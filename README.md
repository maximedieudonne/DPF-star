# DPF-STAR Repository

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/887228134.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14163623)


## Introduction
This repository contains the code associated with the paper: **"New Scale-Invariant Sulcal Depth Measure: A Response to the Conceptual and Methodological Problems of Sulcal Depth Estimation."** 

The code here provides tools to compute curvature and a novel DPF-STAR depth measure for brain surface meshes, addressing limitations in traditional sulcal depth estimation methods.

## Installation
First, fork and Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DPF-star
cd DPF-star
```
Then, follow the installation steps to set up and run this project on your machine.

### Installation Steps

#### Option 1 : automatic installation of the conda env (recommended)

1. Make sure **Conda** is installed on your machine. You can download Miniconda or Anaconda here: [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)  

```
2. Run the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh
```
This script will:
* Create a Conda environment using the environment.yml file.
* Activate the newly created environment.

If the script does not execute, make sure it is executable:
 ```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
#### Option 2 : manual installation of the conda env
If you prefer not to use the script, here are the manual steps:
1. Create the Conda environment from the environment.yml file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
2. Activate the Conda environment:
```bash
conda activate your_project_name
```

### Option 3 : editable mode.

If you want to contribute to this repository, you can install all the dependencies and the application in editable mode using 'pip install -e .'. This command installs the package as a symbolic link, allowing you to test changes locally as you develop without needing to reinstall the package. For more details about editable installations, see [the pip documentation on editable installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs).

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
```bash
cd path/to/DPF-STAR
```
2. Upgrade pip and setuptools:
```bash
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
```
3. Install the package in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
You can run pip install -e . after creating either a Python virtual environment or a Conda environment. While Conda environments are larger in size, they offer more robust dependency management and support for non-Python packages. For maximum flexibility, it is recommended to create and activate a Conda environment first, then use pip install -e . to install the application in editable mode, allowing you to develop and test changes while benefiting from Conda's comprehensive package management.

## Repository Organization
There are 2 main files in this repo : 
(1) app : functions you can run on command line and allow you to use the dpf-star method for your own studies.
(2) research : the scripts used for the different experience introduced in the article.
The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext

## Workspace Configuration
Before running the app, adjust the workspace configuration to ensure smooth operation:

1. Update `.vscode/settings.json` with the correct project root directory path.
2. Update `.vscode/launch.json` with the correct project root directory path.
3. Adjust the `config.py` file to point to the correct project root directory.

## How to Use the App

### Usage Overview
The app allows you to:
- Compute the **curvature** of a mesh.
- Calculate the **DPF depth** of a mesh.
- Calculate the **DPF-STAR depth** of a mesh.
- Quickly visualize the **texture** applied on the mesh.

### Commands

#### 1. Compute Curvature
To compute the curvature of a mesh, run:
```bash
python -m app.compute_curvature {path/to/your/mesh} --display
```
Replace `{path/to/your/mesh}` with the actual path to your mesh file.
- If the `--display` argument is added, the script will automatically run the dash code for visualising the mesh with the curvature texture.

Here a screenshot of what you get with the example mesh : 
<img src="./images/display_curvature.png" alt="curvature display" width="500"/>

#### 2. Compute DPF Depth
To calculate the DPF depth of a mesh, use:
```bash
python -m app.compute_dpf {path/to/your/mesh} --curvature {curvature/path} --display
```
- If the `--curvature` argument is not specified, the script will look for a curvature file in the corresponding folder or compute it if necessary.
- If the `--display` argument is added, the script will automatically run the dash code for visualising the mesh with the dpf texture.

Here a screenshot of what you get with the example mesh : 
<img src="./images/display_dpf.png" alt="dpf display" width="500"/>

#### 3. Compute DPF-STAR Depth
To calculate the DPF-STAR depth of a mesh, use:
```bash
python -m app.compute_dpfstar {path/to/your/mesh} --curvature {curvature/path} --display
```
- If the `--curvature` argument is not specified, the script will look for a curvature file in the corresponding folder or compute it if necessary.
- If the `--display` argument is added, the script will automatically run the dash code for visualising the mesh with the dpf-star texture.

Here a screenshot of what you get with the example mesh : 
<img src="./images/display_dpfstar.png" alt="dpfstar display" width="500"/>

#### 4. Visualize Textures
To visualize textures on a mesh, use the following command:
```bash
python -m app.visualiser {path/to/your/mesh} --texture {texture/path} 
```
Replace `{path/to/your/mesh}` and `{texture/path}` with the paths to your mesh and texture files, respectively.

you will get :
```bash
Dash is running on http://XXX.X.X.X:XXXX/

 * Serving Flask app 'visualizer'
 * Debug mode: on
```
simply copy paste the url http://XXX.X.X.X:XXXX/ is your internet browser
